- linear approx of the CO2 function. Study validity of hypothesis depending on the size of aggregated vehicles.

- priority : simple resolution of 1-EV problem

- prove that water-filling is correct when the function is convex (not the case here !)

- create a merit order or load curve that leaves a non-convex domain for the EVs to charge

- compare methods : in speed and CO2 on random curves as a single problem, with different energies and max power.
                    in speed and CO2 on the "realistic" curve with BRD and aggregation
